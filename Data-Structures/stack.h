/*

Stack and Queue are elementary data structures that have a
common generalization: the double-ended queue (this has
far fewer applications though).

*/

/*  

The stack is the simplest of all structures, with an obvious interpretation:
putting objects on the stack and taking them off again, with access possible only to the
top item. For this reason they are sometimes also described as LIFO storage: last in, first out.

Stacks occur in programming wherever we have nested blocks,
local variables, recursive definitions, or backtracking. Typical programming
exercises that involve a stack are the evaluation of arithmetic expressions with
parentheses and operator priorities, or search in a labyrinth with backtracking.

The stack should support at least the following operations:

1. push (obj): Put obj on the stack, making it the top item.
2. pop() : Return the top object from the stack and remove it from the stack.
3. stack_empty() : Test whether the stack is empty.
