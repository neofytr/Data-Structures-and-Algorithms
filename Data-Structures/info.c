A data structure is a method to realize a set of operations on some data.

In general, a data structure is a kind of higher-level instruction in a virtual machine: when an
algorithm needs to execute some operations many times, it is reasonable to identify
what exactly the needed operations are and how they can be realized in the most efficient way.
This is the basic question of data structures: given a set of operations whose intended behavior is known,
how should we realize that behavior?
